Let’s go step-by-step and unpack **closures in Go** first, then break down **exactly what’s happening** in our code snippets.

---

## **1. What is a Closure in Go?**

In Go, a **closure** is a function value that **captures variables from the scope in which it was defined**, even after that scope has finished executing.

That means:

* The **inner function** remembers the environment (variables) from where it was created.
* These captured variables **live on in memory** as long as the returned function value exists.
* Each returned function has its **own copy** of those variables.

---

### **Analogy**

Think of closures like:

> A backpack 🎒 that a function carries with it wherever it goes, containing the variables from the place where it was born.

---

## **2. Your `adder()` example**

```go
func adder() func() int {
    i := 0
    fmt.Println("Previous value of i:", i)

    return func() int {
        i++
        fmt.Println("Adding 1 to i")
        return i
    }
}
```

### Step-by-Step:

1. When `adder()` is called, it creates a **local variable** `i := 0`.
2. It returns an **anonymous function** (`func() int { ... }`) that:

   * Accesses and modifies `i` even after `adder()` has finished running.
3. This works because the **closure** keeps a reference to `i` in memory (on the heap, not the stack).

---

### How `main()` uses it:

```go
sequence := adder()

fmt.Println(sequence())
fmt.Println(sequence())
fmt.Println(sequence())
```

**Execution flow:**

* `sequence := adder()`

  * Calls `adder()` → sets `i = 0` → returns a closure that can increment `i`.
  * `sequence` now holds that closure **and the "backpack" with i**.
* First `sequence()` → increments `i` to 1 → prints and returns 1.
* Second `sequence()` → increments `i` to 2 → prints and returns 2.
* Third `sequence()` → increments `i` to 3 → prints and returns 3.
* Fourth → increments to 4.

---

### Important: `sequence2 := adder()`

* This **calls `adder()` again**, creating a **new and independent `i`** starting from 0.
* That’s why `sequence2()` starts counting from 1 again.
* Each closure has **its own copy** of `i`.

---

## **3. The `multiplier` example inside `main`**

```go
multiplier := func() func(int) int {
    product := 2
    return func(x int) int {
        product *= x
        return product
    }
}()
```

### What’s happening:

1. We define an **anonymous function** that:

   * Declares `product := 2`
   * Returns a closure `func(x int) int` that multiplies `product` by `x`.
2. The `()` at the end **calls it immediately**, so `multiplier` becomes:

   * The closure `func(int) int` with `product` in its backpack.

**Usage:**

```go
fmt.Println(multiplier(5)) // product = 2 * 5 = 10
fmt.Println(multiplier(3)) // product = 10 * 3 = 30
```

* Notice that `product` **persists between calls**, because it’s stored in the closure’s environment.

---

## **4. Memory Perspective (Heap vs Stack)**

* Normally, a local variable like `i` or `product` would be on the **stack**, and vanish after the function returns.
* But closures need those variables **after the function exits**.
* Go’s compiler detects this and **allocates them on the heap** instead.
* The closure stores a reference to them → as long as the closure is alive, the variables stay alive in memory.

---

## **5. Why Closures are Useful**

* **Stateful functions** without global variables.
* **Factory functions** (like `adder` and `multiplier`) that produce customized behavior.
* **Callbacks** that need to remember context.
* **Encapsulation**: we hide variables from the outside world but keep them accessible to the inner function.

## **1. What is Recursion?**

Recursion is when a function **calls itself**, either **directly** or **indirectly**, to solve a problem.

A recursive function:

1. Has a **base case** — a condition where it stops calling itself.
2. Has a **recursive case** — where it calls itself with smaller/simpler input.

---

### **General Syntax in Go**

```go
func functionName(args) returnType {
    if baseCondition {
        return baseValue
    }
    // recursive case
    return functionName(smallerArgs)
}
```

---

## **2. Example — Factorial**

Mathematically:

```
n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1
0! = 1 (base case)
```

**In Go:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1 // base case
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1) // recursive call
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(factorial(5)) // Output: 120
}
```

**How it works:**

```
factorial(5) → 5 * factorial(4)
factorial(4) → 4 * factorial(3)
factorial(3) → 3 * factorial(2)
factorial(2) → 2 * factorial(1)
factorial(1) → 1 * factorial(0)
factorial(0) → 1  (base case reached)

Now it returns:
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

---

## **3. Example — Fibonacci**

Fibonacci sequence:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

**In Go:**

```go
func fibonacci(n int) int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n // base cases: fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1
    }
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) // recursive case
}
```

---

## **4. Important Points in Go Recursion**

* **Base case is mandatory** — without it, recursion runs forever and crashes with a stack overflow.
* Go optimizes tail recursion *sometimes*, but not as aggressively as some languages (like Scheme).
* Recursion is more readable for problems like:

  * Tree traversal
  * Divide and conquer algorithms
  * Mathematical definitions
* But **iteration is often faster** in Go due to lower function call overhead.

---

## **5. Stack vs Heap in Recursion**

* Every recursive call adds a **stack frame** (variables, return address).
* Deep recursion can cause **stack overflow** if too many calls happen before hitting the base case.
* That’s why we must ensure **small inputs progress toward the base case**.
